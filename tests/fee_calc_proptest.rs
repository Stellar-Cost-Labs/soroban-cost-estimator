//! Property-based tests for the fee calculator.
//!
//! These complement the deterministic unit tests in `src/report/fee_calc.rs`
//! by checking invariants that must hold for *any* input, not just the
//! hand-picked cases:
//!
//! * the refundable portion is never negative (the defensive floor in
//!   `compute_fee_breakdown`),
//! * the reported totals are internally consistent and round-trip through
//!   the XLM string representation,
//! * the non-refundable fee is a commutative sum of independent component
//!   fees (swapping a quantity with its rate does not change the result).
